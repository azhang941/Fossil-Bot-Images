Hello! Help us improve the bot by adding images to this repository.

Here are some requirements:
* Place photos in the appropriate folder
* Photos should be in a .png, .jpg, or .jpeg format
* Photos should be 8MB or smaller, preferably smaller than 4MB
* Photos should not have text that gives away the answer
* Photos should be accurate
* Photos should not be duplicated
* Filenames should not be duplicated

## Adding Pictures
If you're new to Git and GitHub, an easy way to get started is with GitHub Desktop.
1. Create a GitHub account if you haven't already.
2. Install GitHub Desktop [here](https://desktop.github.com/). Open it.
3. Log in with your GitHub account. Follow the tutorial [here](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop) to clone and fork this repository. When you get to step 2, use `"URL"` instad of `GitHub.com` with the url `https://github.com/tctree333/Fossil-Bot-Images.git`. Note the generated `Local Path`. Continue as normal.
4. In your file explorer on your computer, navigate to the generated path. Now you are ready to add images! Drag and drop downloaded images to the appropriate folder, ensuring that images meet the requirements above and deleting `"image.placeholder"` if the folder is not empty. However, if the folder does *not* have images, **do not delete** `"image.placeholder"`.
5. Once you are done adding as many pictures as you want, go back to GitHub Desktop and click `"create a fork"` in the bottom left corner. Fork the repository, and hit `"Commit to master"` in the bottom left corner. Then, hit `"Push Origin"`.
6. Finally, hit `"View on GitHub"` and click `"Pull Request"` near the middle right. Click `"Create Pull Request"`, give it a name and description if you want, and then `"Create Pull Request"`.

Congrats! You just helped add images to the bot! Give me a few days to approve your pull request, and the bot will be using your new images. You don't have to stop here, though. Add more pictures by repeating steps 4-6, though you may have to click `"Fetch Origin"` occasionally to make sure your copy is up to date.

**Thanks for helping out!**
